        Provide a detailed description of the issue.  Include relevant information, such as:
        - The feature or configuration option you encounter the issue with.
        - Screenshots, screen recordings, or other supporting media (as needed).
        - If this is a regression of an existing issue that was closed or resolved, please include the previous item reference (Discussion, Issue, PR, commit) in your description.

        > [!TIP]
        > **Not sure what information to include?**
        > Here are some recommendations:
        > - **Input issues:** include your keyboard layout, a screenshot of logged keystrokes from the terminal inspector's "Keyboard" tab (Linux: <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>; MacOS: <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>), input method, Linux input method engine (IBus, Fcitx 5, or none) and its version.
        > - **Font issues:** include the problematic character(s), the output of `ghostty +show-face` for these character(s), and if they work in other applications.
        > - **Terminal emulation issues (including image rendering issues):** attach an [asciinema](https://docs.asciinema.org/getting-started/) cast file, shell script, or text file for reproduction.
        > - **Renderer issues:** (Linux) include your OpenGL version, graphics card, driver version.
        > - **Crashes:** (macOS) include the [Sentry UUID](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty?tab=readme-ov-file#crash-reports); (Linux) try to reproduce using a debug build and provide the stack trace.

        When using SSH to connect to my remote Linux machine from my local macOS device in Ghostty, I try to run `clear`, and the screen does not clear.  Instead, I see the following error message printed to the terminal: `Error opening terminal: xterm-ghostty.`
